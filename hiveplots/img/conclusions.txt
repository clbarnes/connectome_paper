Notes: nodes sorted by physical degree, ball size determined by number of neurons at that position
- Hub nodes (high-degree interneuron pairs AVA, AVB, PVC) do not participate strongly in the monoamine network
- Monoamines plug the gap between sensory and motor neurons where there is little physical connectivity
- Interneuron-motor monoamine connectivity is fairly sparse, concurrent with high synaptic and particularly gap
junction connectivity
- The physically-disconnected CAN pair (here classified as interneurons) participate significantly in the MA network

Nodes sorted by degree
- dop and tyr secretors restricted to sensory and motor respectively
- dop secretory cells dominate in terms of number of nodes reached
- Significant intra-class signalling in each subnetwork
