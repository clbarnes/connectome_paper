Notes: nodes sorted by physical degree, ball size determined by number of neurons at that position
- Hub nodes (high-degree interneuron pairs AVA, AVB, PVC) do not participate strongly in the monoamine network
  - they're likely to be coordinating fundamentally different things
  - the monoamine rich club will be distinct
- Monoamines plug the gap between sensory and motor neurons where there is little physical connectivity
  - neurons intentionally isolated from direct interaction (allowing sensory processing) can still feed back over
  longer timescales
- Interneuron-motor monoamine connectivity is fairly sparse, concurrent with high synaptic and particularly gap
junction connectivity
- The physically-disconnected CAN pair (here classified as interneurons) participate significantly in the MA network
  - Having disconnected neurons is counterintuitive, but if they interact with monoamines it makes more sense

Nodes sorted by degree
- dop and tyr secretors restricted to sensory and motor respectively
  - suggestive of transmitter having some global significance (as opposed to contextual)
- dop secretory cells dominate in terms of number of nodes reached
  - involved in setting a global state in the animal?
- Significant intra-class signalling in each transmitter subnetwork
- Most sensory neurons have some MA activity, where there are a significant number of interneurons and some motor
neurons which don't
