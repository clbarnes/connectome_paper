assortativity: full-full degree
density:
global_efficiency:
mean_betweenness_centrality: unweighted
mean_clustering: mean nodewise clustering coefficient, NOT global transitivity
modularity: maximum modularity - probably don't trust this as bctpy gives different answers to BCT due to differences in underlying linear algebra implementation
path_length:
small_worldness: probably don't trust this as
transitivity: use this as clustering
weighted_mean_clustering: mean nodewise clustering coefficient weighted by full degree of nodes
