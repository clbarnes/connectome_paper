NB:
Line graphs show survival functions, i.e. y = proportion of nodes whose metric value >= x
    A y-intercept < 1 signifies a number of nodes whose value = 0
    Be aware of inconsistent lin/log scales between metrics (the result of some experimentation of what looks best)
Box plot/ scatters show the distribution of null graphs in the box+whisker, and the scatter point shows the real value
The bar graph is a bar graph :)

assortativity:
- p-values are actually meaningful rather than just being minuscule
- All graphs are generally disassortative, but generally more assortative than controls (except gap junction)
- MA and NP networks are much less assortative than the physical graphs, but the real networks are significantly more
 assortative than the null models: i.e. despite the fact that there is a great deal of broadcasting to
 low-degree nodes, there is much more communication between hubs than expected. Possibly suggestive of coordinating
 gross body state?

betweenness_centrality:
- I'm not really sure how to interpret this!

mean_betweenness_centrality:
- MA presumably has a very low proportion of node pairs connected by a path longer than 1, which is why its box looks so
 odd

clustering:
- Nodewise clustering coefficient
- Very busy!
- Generally, real curves are shifted significantly right of the null graphs (i.e. real graph nodes are more highly
clustered than null graph nodes)
- MA lines cross because while fewer real nodes participate in any sort of cluster, there is a much than expected
number of highly-clustered nodes

mean_clustering:
- p-values are important because mean clustering will increase with density
- Collapsing nodewise clustering coefficient into a single value loses the interesting MA behaviour noted above
- Other than that, generally consistent with what's seen in the survival plots

degrees:
- This is a sanity check to see how many edges we lose/gain by stacking randomised layers rather than randomising a
whole graph (or rather, how it affects the degree distribution)
- For single-layer graphs, the null and real lines completely overlap (necessarily)
- The lines for combined graphs are generally fairly close (reassuring)
    - Exception is gj-syn: because these networks have a fairly high redundancy in the real network but not in the nulls
    - Conversely, the fact that the other lines are close suggests that randomising them does not change the extent of
    redundancy (i.e. they probably weren't very redundant to begin with, or the degree distribution makes redundancy
    inevitable)

density:
- Not much to interpret but worth noting because of how it affects the other metrics
    - I suppose it might be worth representing this as the box/scatter to show the effect of the randomisation
    protocol on number of edges
- Combined graph density is not the sum of its components' densities, due to redundancy

path_length:
- Mean length of shortest path *between each connected pair of nodes*
    - MA has a comparably large p-value because not that many nodes are connected (possibly NP as well)
    - This is why combined graphs seem to have a longer mean path length than, e.g. MA (more connected nodes)
- Exceedingly small p-values (some smaller than double precision i.e. 2.23x10^(-308), which is a bit of a pain)
- Paths are longer than null in order to allow separate channels of information - can't do processing if all the
circuits are shorted (i.e. complete graph)

global_efficiency:
- I don't think this metric adds much value if we're including path length, and path length is more intuitive

modularity:
- All real graphs are much more modular than null models
    - In particular, combined physical is more modular than its components where expectation is less modular than
    components
- Addition of neuropeptides significantly increases modularity over gj+syn+ma
