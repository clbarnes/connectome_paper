assortativity:
- p-values are actually meaningful rather than just being minuscule
- All graphs are generally disassortative, but generally more assortative than controls (except gap junction)
- MA and NP networks are much less assortative than the physical graphs, but the real networks are significantly more
 assortative than the null models: i.e. despite the fact that there is a great deal of broadcasting to
 low-degree nodes, there is much more communication between hubs than expected. Possibly suggestive of coordinating
 gross body state?
